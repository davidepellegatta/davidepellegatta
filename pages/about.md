Hi! This is my informal blog. In these days a lot is going on in my working life so I've decided that it's time to share.

The thing is... that I've always posponed the idea of writing my thoughts down because time is never enough. This is about to change.

## Who am I?

Davide. Class 1982. Architect @Â Spindox. During the last years I had the great possibility of working in a constantly changing context. I've started with Java/J2EE when monolithic applications were the only choice. 

Then came the era of big SOA products and now it's all changing again.

Today I'm mostly playing with microservices, reactive applications (JavaRX, Akka) and Couchbase. 

I've recently had the opportunity to experiment .Net Core & C# for an OpenID Connect authentication server.
